# Day 2 Summary - MediScan-AI

**Date:** 2025-10-07

## Objectives Completed
   Data preprocessing pipeline built
   Class weights calculated (1.9448, 0.6730)
   Data augmentation configured
   5-Fold Cross Validation setup
   Custom Dataset and DataLoaders created

## Key Metrics
- Training images: 5216
- Test images: 624
- Batch size: 32
- K-Folds: 5

## Augmentation Strategy
- Random rotation (±15°)
- Random horizontal flip (50%)
- Random affine transformation
- Color jitter (brightness & contrast)

## Next Steps (Day 3)
1. Build ResNet50 baseline model
2. Implement training loop with class weights
3. Train first fold as proof of concept
4. Set up metrics tracking

## Status
   Day 2 Complete - Ready for Model Building
